     <p>Consider this the last guacamole recipe that you will ever need.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

         <li>Ripe Avocados</li>
         <li>Citrus</li>

     <ol>
         <li>Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with kosher salt.

         <li>Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, salt, and fresh lime juice. Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), five or six minutes.</li>
