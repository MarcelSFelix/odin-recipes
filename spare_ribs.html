    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These pork spare ribs will melt in your mouth and you will not be able to live without them anymore.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fajita seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
        <li>2 racks pork spare ribs, fat trimmed</li>
        <li>1 cup beer</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared brown mustard</li>

    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix brown sugar, fajita seasoning, and paprika in a bowl. Rub both sides of pork spareribs with the brown sugar mixture. Place spareribs in a 9x13-inch baking pan; cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Whisk together beer, garlic, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Tear off 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and lay them shiny-side down. Place a rack of spare ribs on each sheet, meaty-side up. Tear off 2 more sheets of foil and place them on top of the spare ribs, shiny-side up. Begin tightly folding the edges of the foil together to create a sealed packet. Just before sealing completely, divide beer mixture evenly into each packet. Complete the seal. Place the packets side-by-side on an 11x14-inch baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake ribs in the preheated oven until the ribs are very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully open each packet and drain drippings into a saucepan. You may only need the drippings from one packet. Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat the saucepan over medium-high and simmer drippings until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Brush the thickened sauce over ribs.</li>
    <li>Preheat the broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Return ribs to the oven and broil until the sauce is lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
</ol>
